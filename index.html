    <h1>1.What is node.js?</h1>
    <p >Nodejs is an open source,cross-platform,javaScript runtime environment built on v8 javaScript engine.</p>
    <p >It has following features which are metioned below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is asynchronous in nature means when it receive another request it resolves it and make it available for for another request.</li>
        <li>It is event-driven and single-threaded which means server conatins a single thread i.e processed one after another.</li>
        <li>It has non-blocking properties like it does not block the execution process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>2.What is NPM?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>NPM stands for the node package manager which is used for node dependency management.</li>
        <li>NPM gets installed with NodeJs installation.</li>
        <li>NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code.</li>
        <li>Note:NPM uses Nested dependencies mean that any dependency is again dependent on another dependency</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>3.What are the modules in Node.js?</h1>
    <p >
        In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.
        Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.
        Modules are of three types:
        <ul>
            <li>Core Modules/Internal modules:Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js installation. These modules can be loaded into the program by using the require function.</li>
            <li>Local Modules/Custom Modules:Local modules are created locally in your Node.js application, Means a modules that calculates various operations. </li>
            <li>Third-Party Modules:Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package Manager(NPM).These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>4.What is the purpose of the module.exports?</h1>
    <p >Module.exports is the instruction that tells Node. js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to “export” from a given file so other files are allowed to access the exported code.</p>
    <p >By module.exports, we can export functions, objects, and their references from one file and can use them in other files by importing them by require() method.</p>
    <h1>5.Difference between default export and named export?</h1>
    <p >
        <ul>
            <span>Named Exports:</span>
            <li>Named exports are useful to export several values.</li>
            <li>Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file</li>
            <li>Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the object, function or variable that was exported.</li>
            <li>During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <span>Default Exports:</span>
            <li>Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function, variable.</li>
            <li>During the import, we can use any name to import.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>6.How do you import any module in Node.js</h1>
    <p >Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in the imported module in another file. The result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation.</p>
    Example:const a = require('./func')
